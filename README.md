- First Project: basic setup and color scheme
- Second Project: basic layout and styling (play around with view, card, scrollable, button, link, etc)
- Third Project: making password generator app. In here I've learned about:
  - a). **useState**: It's about how to use data (boolean, number, string, etc) to change the view of the app
  - b). **Manage and using package**: (Yup, Formik, and react-native-bouncy-checkbox)
  - c). **Clipboard feature**: My app also allows users to copy the generated password to the clipboard
- coming soon

## If you copy or clone each project make sure to change the main directory's name with this rules:
- first-project -> FirstApp
- second-project -> SecondApp
- third-project -> ThirdProject
- coming soon

## Also don't forget to download all dependency (use npm install) or (npm i) so it will generate node_modules folder in your project and download all dependencies according to package.json
