## If you copy or clone each project make sure to change the main directory's name with this rules:
- first-project -> FirstApp
- second-project -> SecondApp
- third-project -> ThirdProject
- coming soon

## Also don't forget to download all dependency (use npm install) or (npm i) so it will generate node_modules folder in your project and download all dependencies according to package.json
