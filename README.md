- First Project: basic setup and color scheme
- Second Project: basic layout and styling (play around with view, card, scrollable, button, link, etc)
- Third Project: making password generator app. In here I've learned about:
  - **useState**: It's about how to use data (boolean, number, string, etc) to change the view of the app
  - **Manage and using package**: (Yup, Formik, and react-native-bouncy-checkbox)
  - **Clipboard feature**: My app also allows users to copy the generated password to the clipboard
- Fourth Project: making color randomizer app. In here I've learned about:
  - **State Management**: ​​Use useState to store the background color and color of each shape.
  - **Random Color**: The getRandomColor() function ensures that the shape color is not the same as the background.
  - **Interaction**: TouchableOpacity handles button clicks to change colors.
  - **Position & Style**: Use StyleSheet and absolute positioning to style elements.
  - **Custom Shapes**: Triangles, squares, circles, and hexagons built with React Native CSS.
- Fifth Project: making dice roller app. In here I've learned about:
  - **Haptic Feedback**: Use react-native-haptic-feedback for vibrations when buttons are pressed.
  - **Dice Randomizer**: Generates random numbers (1-6) and changes the image based on the result (using switch-case). 
- Sixth Project: making currency exchange application. In here I've learned about:
  - **Snackbar Notification**: Use react-native-snackbar to display error messages or information.
  - **FlatList**: Display a list of currencies in a grid with FlatList. This method is more efficient because the app did not load all of the data but only the data displayed.
  - **Constant**: Provide some constants value (data) that can be called and used in the app
- Seventh Project: making Tic Tac Toe app using React-Native. In here I've learned about:
  - **Array**: used in arranging tic-tac-toe blocks totaling 9 items. Allows easy monitoring of win or end conditions
  - **FlatList**: Display a list of currencies in a grid with FlatList. This method is more efficient because the app did not load all of the data but only the data displayed.
  - **Icons**: Using the react-native-vector-icons/FontAwesome library allows the application to implement the required icons. Also added react-native-config.js in the root folder of the project to complete the code
  - **useCallback**: Runs a function that is only recreated if its dependencies change.
  - **useEffect**: Combined with useCallback to monitor dependency changes

## If you copy or clone each project make sure to change the main directory's name with this rules:
- first-project -> FirstApp
- second-project -> SecondApp
- third-project -> ThirdProject
- fourth-project -> FourthProject
- fifth-project -> FifthProject
- sixth-project -> SixthProject
- seventh-project -> SeventhProject
- coming soon

## Also don't forget to download all dependency (use npm install) or (npm i) so it will generate node_modules folder in your project and download all dependencies according to package.json
