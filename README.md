- First Project: basic setup and color scheme
- Second Project: basic layout and styling (play around with view, card, scrollable, button, link, etc)
- Third Project: making password generator app. In here I've learned about:
  - a). **useState**: It's about how to use data (boolean, number, string, etc) to change the view of the app
  - b). **Manage and using package**: (Yup, Formik, and react-native-bouncy-checkbox)
  - c). **Clipboard feature**: My app also allows users to copy the generated password to the clipboard
- Fourth Project: making color randomizer app. In here I've learned about:
  - a). **State Management**: ​​Use useState to store the background color and color of each shape.
  - b). **Random Color**: The getRandomColor() function ensures that the shape color is not the same as the background.
  - c). **Interaction**: TouchableOpacity handles button clicks to change colors.
  - d). **Position & Style**: Use StyleSheet and absolute positioning to style elements.
  - e). **Custom Shapes**: Triangles, squares, circles, and hexagons built with React Native CSS.
- Fifth Project: making dice roller app. In here I've learned about:
  - a). **Haptic Feedback**: Use react-native-haptic-feedback for vibrations when buttons are pressed.
  - b). **Dice Randomizer**: Generates random numbers (1-6) and changes the image based on the result (using switch-case).
